# Codeshift Community

Codeshift Community is a community-owned global registry and documentation hub for codemods. _Think [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) for codemods._ Providing library users & maintainers with facilities to help write, test, publish and consume codemods in a structured, standardized and familar way.

## Goals üèÜ
Our goal is to build a community around codemods to help normalise both authoring and consuming them, to make it a standard developement practice throughout the javascript ecosystem. In doing so, we hope to also demistify codemods, which are often seen as "arcane knowledge" and generally too hard to warrant learning and writing.
