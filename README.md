Codeshift Community is a community-owned global registry and documentation hub for codemods. _Think [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) for codemods._ Providing library maintainers & users with facilities to help write, test, publish and consume codemods in a structured, standardized and familiar way.

_Inspired by Facebook's [jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift)_
