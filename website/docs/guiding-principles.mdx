There are several guiding prinicples we follow in this project.

## Target a package & version

- APIs are always changing
- Codemods written at a specific point of time aren't always going to work into the future
- So we beleive codemods should support libraries moving from one API to another, and target a specific package and specific version

This gives us a lot of benefits,

1. It's obvious the scope and intent of a codemod (migrating a package from one version to another)
2. Codemods can be 'playable in a sequence', for example migrating from an older verison of `@atlaskit/button` to the latest is possible for example `v14 -> v15 -> v16`.
3. TODO`

## Everyone should ship codemods

Codemods aren't complicated, anyone who has writtin anything in jQuery should be able to write a codemod with relative ease.
We want to remove the stigma that "codemods are hard" or "they take a long time to write" and get everyone into the healthy practice of writing them to make dependeny management within the javascript ecosystem easier.

## Codemods help expedite adoption

Reading and understanding changelogs is often confusing and painful. We aim to expedite adoption through automation.
