Consuming codemods is simple,

## Via command line

Most often you would want to run a single codemod, our CLI is all you need to do that.

To make sure you're always on the latest version of the Codeshift cli, we recommend you use `npx`. (You can also install it globally with `npm install -g @codemod/cli`)

`npx @codemod/cli -package @atlaskit/button@14.0.0 project/path/to/src`

The cli tool will then:

- Attempt to fetch codemods for the `@atlaskit/button` package.
- Look for a codemod targetting version `14.0.0`
- Parse and transform all source files matching the provided path

## Consuming local codemods

For codemods not published to the community repo, you can supply your own transform

`npx @codemod/cli -transform path/to/transform.ts project/path/to/src`

## Parsing TypeScript, Babel and more
